# Structural-Analysis-Matricial
This projects aims to use matrix calculus to determine the forces and displacements of the structures thus to obtain the stress state of each member of the bar, either traction (+) or compression (-).
Also, it introduces several aicraft wing structure and landing gear structural analysis
